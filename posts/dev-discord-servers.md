Sharing some Discord servers for developers, good for hanging out or asking questions :). Some are popular or well known that you may have have already heard of. 

## General 
 [The Coding Den](https://discord.gg/code)
 
 [The Programmer's Hangout](https://discord.gg/programming)

## React
 [Reactiflux](https://discord.gg/9QwzGm2tvm)

## Ben Awad
[Ben Awad](https://discord.gg/44KtMNmJEZ)

He's truly the GOAT (Greatest Of All Time) hahaha. Also, he has a Youtube channel that has good tutorials and insightful videos on react and programming topics.
  
## CS Students
 [CS Majors](https://discord.gg/csmajors)

Really good server for cs students out there.

## Electron 
 [electronjs.org](https://discord.gg/csmajors)

 Electron is the most popular and most used framework for cross-platform applications. The docs are good but not much other resources out there, yet this discord is good to ask questions and possibly find collaborators. 

## Rust 
[The Rust Programming Language](https://discord.gg/n2dSXhm4Kh)

I love rust hahaha, still learning but the community is great and the discord is no different. 

## Solana + Anchor
[Solana Tech](https://discord.gg/solana)

Solana is still fairly new and the eco-system yet I love their community and it's been super fun learning and building on Solana with Anchor and Rust :). I have to make a new Discord to join because for some reason my number is already associated with a different username/account?? lol if anybody knows about this 'bug' contact me haha (fr tho). 

[Anchor](https://discord.gg/2q4VzVYtZQ)

According to [Anchor's github repo](https://github.com/project-serum/anchor) - Anchor is a framework for Solana's Sealevel runtime providing several convenient developer tools for writing smart contracts. 

Along with Solana, Anchor is fairly new too. Also, been having fun learning anchor and writing Solana smart contracts. 

The Discord is super active and even the creator of Anchor, Armani Ferrante
